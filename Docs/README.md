# Finmer Editor Documentation

This folder contains the source for the Editor documentation pages.

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

## Installation

To build and view the documentation website locally, you must have node.js 16 or newer installed.

In a shell or command prompt, run the following command to download and install all required dependencies:

```
$ npm install
```

### Local Development

```
$ npm run start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live in the browser without having to restart the server or refresh the page, so you can edit the site contents and quickly view the result.

### Build

```
$ npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

# Player Interface

These functions and properties are members of the Player instance. You can get the player object using the `Player` global variable.

Note that the Player object is a Creature and therefore a GameObject, so you can use both the [Creature interface](/script-reference/creature) and the [GameObject interface](/script-reference/gameobject) as well.

# Asset Instantiation

With these constructors, you can create instances of assets. These are used in various other functions; for example adding a participant to a combat session requires a Creature. The name specified in these constructors must be the unique asset name, as it appears in the editor's asset list. 

<LuaReference group={ApiGroup} />

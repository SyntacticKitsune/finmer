# Let's make a quest!

Let's get our paws wet with a deep dive into the Editor. In this tutorial, we will be making a small sample module to show off all the important features of the game and editor, to help you get started with creating your own adventures for Finmer!

:::note
It may be useful to have another instance of the Editor side-by-side, loaded with the Core module, so that you can more clearly see where your edits would fit, as well as how the game's official content was built.
:::

This guide assumes that you are new to the Editor, and have at least read the ['About Modules' primer](/getting-started/about-modules). We'll try to introduce concepts as they become relevant. If at any point you'd like to read more detailed info, feel free to browse the [asset documentation](/category/assets).

The tutorial is composed of four sections:

1. [An Unassuming Job Notice](/tutorial/part1) shows you how to set up a mod that builds on top of the official game.
2. [A Friendly Chat](/tutorial/part2) shows you how to build a dialogue tree.
3. [The Campsite](/tutorial/part3) shows you how to build a new scene from scratch, with a combat encounter.
4. [Final Touches](/tutorial/part4) shows you how to wrap up your quest, and how to customize combat text.

Let's dive in!

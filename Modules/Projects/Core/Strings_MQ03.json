More so than, well... the duties of one in public office, clearly.\" Canbell catches herself and shakes her head almost imperceptibly. \"Now. There's a traveling merchant preparing to head to South Finmer. Would you travel with him and visit our southern friends on my behalf?

It really must have been important, I don't know why else Iso would just up and leave. The notes I found seemingly avoided mentioning what exactly is going on over there, so I'm afraid you're heading in blind.

				"The textures of the meat slurry sloshing around you are nothing short of revolting, somewhere in between grainy mud and a vegetable stew boiled beyond recognition. Said stew is, in fact, one you are slowly but surely adding to. The loud thumping of your captor's heart, the trickle of fluids down below in the lower intestines, and the obnoxiously loud gurgling and groaning of the active stomach, are just about enough to lull you into a deep sleep, were it not for the fading adrenaline keeping you conscious for a few moments more. This stomach is clearly not very used to having this much food to process, and it doesn't really seem to be capable of compacting you tightly. The organ does its best to compress the soupy mush into you, though the effect is limited, and the chyme acts as a kind of buffer in between you and the stomach wall's murderous intent. One of your feet presses into a small opening at the bottom of the furnace. It gently chews at your toes, and you understand it to be the pyloric sphincter that is guzzling up the already-digested meal surrounding you, and with it, your foul, messy shielding. By the time you begin joining your predecessor, you ran out of oxygen hours ago, and with a noisy, rumbling stomach all to yourself, you are no match for the carnivorous appetite of the Red Maw."

Oh, right, he'd had double dinner, some weirdo took a dive while he was trying to sleep off his first meal.\\n\\nThe wolf looming over him steps back with a cheeky grin, shaking his head. \"They squirm well, at least?\" he asks, to which Ethel shakes his head. \"I don't even remember who. Ugh, prey. Er, I need to...\" he grunts, another rather pressing thought occurring to him when his digestive tract emits a particularly noisy groan.\\n\\nIn response, he receives a chuckle and a dismissive wave as he stands up fully, gut wobbling and mushy fluids sloshing within, taking several seconds to adjust his balance to compensate. \"Sure, sure, take a dump if you must. Don't take too long, I need you here,\" the wolf replies. The bluebird simply nods, looking forward greatly to disposing of his digested prey.

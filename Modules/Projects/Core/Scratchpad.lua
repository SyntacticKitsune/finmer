Hey! You found THE SUPER SECRET SCRATCHPAD! This script file contains some of my ideas and thoughts, as well as some overviews and descriptions of the game story.
Don't look if you don't want to be spoiled!

RANDOM THOUGHTS
---------------

* DONE: Lightweight journal entries: list of active objectives (kinda like WoW quick-journal)

* Randall has a reason for being mad, other than just being a jerk in general
    - Someone (business partner? brother?) got eaten
    - Wants revenge: drive Finmer into the ground economically, or revenge-vore ^ predator
    - Ideally, I'd want to make the player sympathize with Randall eventually

* Idea: Some kind of club with a hunky bouncer (big feline?)
    - Someone (bartender?) can give you a 'ticket' to bring to the bouncer that (unbeknownst to player) actually instructs the bouncer to eat them
    - Edit: Could fit into the Town_Pit scene

* Idea: Near end game: Randall forces player to either eat a friend, or get eaten by Randall themselves
    - Edit: Iso would be a good candidate for this
    - Would mean the main story has two endings: join Red Maw, or destroy them

* What if Randall and Iso were super close once? Maybe ex-lovers, or childhood friends.
    - AC_IsoRing --> wedding band

BACKGROUND
----------

Finmer is a fishing town split into north and south parts, a few kms apart. North is situated near a lake and dense forest. South is built on a cliffside and fishes from the sea. Primary export for both is fish and such.


MAIN STORY
----------

South Finmer is occupied by the Red Maw, a gang of bandits who want to tightly control import/export. In response to initial disobedience and resistance, Randall (leader) destroys bridge over an important trade route leading to South Finmer (goal = set example, threaten), severely damaging commerce.

Player worked together with Iso and found out about bridge destruction, tried to prevent it, but failed. Player supposedly let Iso escape safely by creating a distraction, but got caught themselves by some of Randall's followers. The goons injure the player and leave them for dead in North Finmer. Randall himself never saw the player directly (only knows about 'the %species and pantheress') and therefore does not recognize them later.

Game thus opens with a vague memory of the player's last stand, as they wake up the next morning, with no memories of the last few days.

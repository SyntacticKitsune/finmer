Hey! You found THE SUPER SECRET SCRATCHPAD! This script file contains some of my ideas and thoughts, as well as some overviews and descriptions of the game story.

This file contains SPOILERS. Don't look if you care for the story.

SCRIBBLES
---------

* Randall has a reason for being mad, other than just being a jerk in general
    - Someone (business partner? brother?) got eaten
    - Wants revenge: drive Finmer into the ground economically, or revenge-vore ^ predator
    - Ideally, I'd want to make the player sympathize with Randall eventually

* Idea: Some kind of club with a hunky bouncer (big feline?)
    - Someone (bartender?) can give you a 'ticket' to bring to the bouncer that (unbeknownst to player) actually instructs the bouncer to eat them
    - Edit: Could fit into the Town_Pit scene

* Idea: Near end game: Randall forces player to either eat a friend, or get eaten by Randall themselves
    - Edit: Iso would be a good candidate for this
    - Would mean the main story has two endings: join Red Maw, or destroy them

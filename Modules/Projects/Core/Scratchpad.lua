Hey! You found THE SUPER SECRET SCRATCHPAD! This script file contains some of my ideas and thoughts, as well as some overviews and descriptions of the game story.
Don't look if you don't want to be spoiled!

RANDOM THOUGHTS
---------------

* DONE: Lightweight journal entries: list of active objectives (kinda like WoW quick-journal)

* Randall has a reason for being mad, other than just being a jerk in general
    - Someone (business partner? brother?) got eaten
    - Wants revenge: drive Finmer into the ground economically, or revenge-vore ^ predator
    - Ideally, I'd want to make the player sympathize with Randall eventually

* Idea: Some kind of club with a hunky bouncer (big feline?)
    - Someone (bartender?) can give you a 'ticket' to bring to the bouncer that (unbeknownst to player) actually instructs the bouncer to eat them
    - Edit: Could fit into the Town_Pit scene

* Idea: Near end game: Randall forces player to either eat a friend, or get eaten by Randall themselves
    - Edit: Iso would be a good candidate for this
    - Would mean the main story has two endings: join Red Maw, or destroy them

* What if Randall and Iso were super close once? Maybe ex-lovers, or childhood friends.
    - AC_IsoRing --> wedding band

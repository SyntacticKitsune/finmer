Despite the town's significantly smaller stature as compared to their neighbor, South Finmer is not found wanting when it comes to its facilities as a seaport. The town is well-known as a quick access point for transporting goods onto or from the Great North Road, and the moderately impressive harbor area reflects this status appropriately."

From here, you can hike back up the cliffside trail to North Finmer, or go west to enter the harbor town."

A small bell, suspended to the doorframe, rings when the dark wooden door touches it, rousing an elderly-looking stoat from his nap. Entirely nonplussed, his gaze locks on you briefly, before he composes himself and waves a paw. \"Don't let the cold in!\" he rumbles, his voice like an ancient oak. Sheepishly, you reach behind you to close the entryway, the door falling shut with a tired moan. The stoat briefly rubs his eyes, then adjusts his glasses, smiling warmly. \"Welcome, friend. Haven't seen you around before, I think? I'm Pat, humble proprietor of this store.\""

He does not voice the buried accusation, perhaps fearful that he might not leave the room if he does. \"W-we, uh, met,\" Toby stammers. In response to this, the stoat rolls his eyes. \"Obviously,\" he deadpans, before turning his attention to you, his commanding tone leaving little up for discussion. \"Would you mind leaving my staff to work in peace?\""

				"South Finmer, as it turns out, features a local shrine. Such places of worship are relatively common in the Reaches, though often serving more as a place of healing than one of prayer. As such, while the focal point is indeed a lavishly decorated altar at the back of the chamber, the space is not filled with pews as might be expected of a more traditional chapel. Rather, the shrine sees a few unoccupied beds lining one wall, and neatly spaced chairs lining the other. The scent of floral incense combined with the way the light of candles and lanterns bounces off the smooth chalky flagstones makes for a fairly serene scene overall. The large granite altar at the far end of the room sits below an impressive wall tapestry featuring intricate blue and white patterns."

				"\"Yes,\" Willow responds simply. \"One who has studied the Shore sufficiently to see the threads that amber crystals cast, is called an Adept. They may wield it like magic, with all the risks and dangers such a power implies. Indeed, because of its potential for destruction, the trade and use of amber is strictly controlled. I should stress, though, that because of the mineral's rarity and the depth of study required to tame it, there are very, very few Adepts actually out there.\" She smiles then, as if revisiting an old memory. \"I know of only one, though it's been years since we last spoke, so I don't know where he is. In any case, if you wish to learn more, I do believe there is a school dedicated to the study of the Shore and formal training of Adepts, elsewhere on the Continent. They might be able to tell you more.\""

How it can be both so priceless and sacred, yet also dark and volatile, only the spirits know. A shard of what we call amber, can cast its own threads to the Far Shore.\" The white-robed lapine scratches the side of her nose, as if in thought. \"If one but knows how to grasp those threads, it allows one to draw from the beyond without the spirits' permission. The crystals are blessed, to possess such a fantastical connection, and also accursed, to allow for such frightening violations,\" she explains. \"Yet, I will not go so far as to call all Adepts evil. I cannot deny its usefulness in enhancing one's link to the spirits and the Shore, for better or for worse.\" The priestess studies you for a moment, bringing a paw to her chin. \"Tell me, then, traveler.

It is very, very old; I'm surprised it survived this long. But unfortunately, I do not speak its tongue.\" Briefly, she turns to the altar at the back wall, lost in thought. \"Perhaps I can still be of use to you. An old friend of mine may know the right person for this, if he doesn't simply know the glyphs himself. Let me see what I can do; I'll get in touch with you when I learn more.\""

				"\"An astute question,\" the custodian of spirits observes. \"The Far Shore is the beyond, the place where the spirits reside. I admit, we know little of it, other than that it is the place we travel to when we depart this world. When we accept a gift from the spirits, such as by healing an injury or consulting the wisdom of our ancestors, the spirits permit us to draw from the Shore through them. And as such, it must be done respectfully, gently, and only ever with permission.\" To emphasize, Willow gestures to the smooth-hewn altar behind her, decorated with intricate patterns in the sides. Glimmering amber glyphs are carved into the polished stone surface, though they resemble a language you do not recognize. \"I hope this sates your curiosity; I can only share what I know,\" she concludes."

Clearly, she is pleased with your expressed interest. \"I was right to assume you have traveled far, to not have heard of the Shore. But no matter, I can explain.\" She flicks her long, floppy ears once. \"The energy that binds, that ties us to the Shore, dwells all around us, you see. It is in the wind, in the trees, in the rocks below your feet. It is in us, our dear departed ancestors, and every living thing in the Reaches. We call these threads the spirits, and as we honor them with prayer, gifts and celebration, they may provide us with guidance, warmth, and a torch in the night.\" The priestess pauses to let her words sink in.

You did want to be closer to that belly, after all. With a happy sigh, amplified through your physical contact, the wolf finally relents before the lack of breathable air becomes a real problem. Chip rises to all fours again, with you directly below him, and as you rub your eyes and the cold forest air rushes over you again, you find yourself almost longing for that warm, furry blanket. But when you open your eyes once more, expecting to see a sheepish, satisfied wolf, you instead see a pair of wide open jaws, dribbling drool, rushing right for you."

				"In your dazed state, you are no match for the oversized canine's slobbery tongue. It curls around you with ease, not unlike the poorly disguised attempt Chip had made earlier at swallowing you, before his master intervened. Unfortunately for you, there is no such safety net now. The slick throat muscles flex and ripple, a loud, wet swallow shunting you forwards into the slimy tube. Even with the wolf's size, the gullet is skin-tight still. While the wolf's tongue does an excellent job at giving your {player.fur} a goopy, warm drool coating, you're forced to hold your breath as you slide down into the feral's depths, towards that impatiently gurgling stomach you had been admiring so much."

				"Your face presses into a tightly sealed sphincter with a nasty squelch. Somewhat reluctantly, the ring widens for you - not quite enough to fit comfortably, but with your thoroughly slime-coated body, gravity combined with a few peristaltic squeezes is enough to shunt you forward. Chyme and partially digested sludge splashes about as you settle within and conform to the organ's shape; it seems the stomach is still far from empty. Bathing in this lukewarm, acidic muck, you try not to focus too much on the chunky stew sloshing around you. The digestive organ, though, gives you little choice in the matter when it begins clamping down, rippling waves of muscular pressure kneading you into a ball of meat as if you are no different from the rest of it. And in truth, that is exactly what you've been reduced to: whether you had not realized, or chose this anyway, you should have known that the dire wolf's stomach would not be a safe place to stay when he is already processing another meal."

				"You hear a snort behind you as you turn to leave. \"Useless, the lot of you. Have to do everything myself. Get out of here,\" the snow leopardess demands. With a voice dripping frustration and even vitriol, you are left wondering whether this little diversion was worth your time and energy after all. Before you close the door of the town hall, you take a peek backwards at the acting mayor, who has already resumed her work. She meets your stare, scowls again, and brushes her paw toward you as if shooing you away. Oh well - back to the town square it is, then."

				"You barge into the town hall with the confidence of someone who uses the space as their home. To some degree, you may be a regular here - few citizens of this town would visit the Mayor's office as often. Canbell, for her part, sits at her table, always exactly where you expect her when you need her. Interrupted in her scribbles on scattered documents, she wryly glances up at you, saying nothing. The unspoken question is obvious, and she waits for an answer."

				"When you drop the fact that Mayor Iso is, in fact, still alive and kicking, Canbell looks stunned. Tiredly rubbing her eyes, perhaps taking a few quick moments to fully process the scene that is unfolding before her, she drops her pencil on whichever illegible document she was working on. The first question that she utters is the most basic, honest one you could have expected. \"Where is she?\" the snow leopardess asks. \"Where did you see her last?\""

Her eyes narrow, a glimmer of suspicion flashing in them. \"She never told me they were in kahoots together. And that old fool's whole shtick is that his house can't be found unless he wants you to. How convenient.\""

I'll send a detachment there at once,\" she says. \"Thanks for bringing this to my attention, {player.name}.\" A soft sigh follows, the feline rubbing the entirety of her face with both paws. Seems her sleep schedule has been upset a little as of late. \"Is there anything else? What is she doing?\""

The white-furred leopardess takes out a fresh piece of paper and begins scribbling things on it. Even from the respectable distance you have to her, you recognize her handwriting as the exact same illegible chicken-scratch she had produced for you back when you were here asking for work. A lot had changed since then."

A small coin bag, sealed with drawstrings, is flung through the air, into your paws. \"North Finmer thanks you for your service,\" she declares dryly. \"I think that concludes our business. Hopefully your next visit will be slightly less eventful, eh?\""

Taking the hint, you decide to leave."
